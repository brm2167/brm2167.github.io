        <p>
            So, you scanned the QR code. Why? Sure, it was an apppealing offer,
            but did you think about where it came from? Who we are? A
            school club that doesn't actually exist, supposedly handing out free
            trips to anyone fast enough to sign up. Sounds too good to be true,
            right? That's the point. This isn't just a prank &mdash; it's part
            of our research into phishing and our effort to educate people on
            how easily they can be misled.

        <h2>What are QR codes?</h2>
        <p>
            QR codes have been around since the 1990s, but they gained
            significant popularity in recent years, especially during the
            COVID-19 pandemic, as demand for contactless interactions surged.
            These two-dimensional barcodes encode binary data, typically web
            URLs, into a format that can be read by image sensors, such as the
            camera on your smartphone.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What are the risks?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The danger with QR codes lies in the fact that they're designed to
            be read by image sensors, not humans. When you click on a link, you
            can see the URL and assess whether it looks trustworthy &mdash; like
            recognizing that www.amazon.com is safe, while www.ama.zondeals.net
            raises red flags. However, with a QR code, you have no way of
            knowing where it leads until you scan it. Worse still, even if a QR
            code comes from a reliable source, malicious actors can easily cover
            it with their own altered code, which can be hard to spot unless
            you're actively looking for tampering.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Once you scan a malicious QR code, it can open the door to a variety
            of threats. The website may impersonate a legitimate one, prompting
            you to enter sensitive information like login credentials, credit
            card details, or other personal data. Additionally, it could infect
            your device with viruses, ransomware, or other malicious software
            that can slow down your computer, steal valuable data, or lock your
            device until a ransom is paid. You may also face a barrage of
            intrusive ads that can lead to unwanted software installations or
            send you to other harmful websites, putting your device and privacy
            at risk.

            How to spot phishing attempts
        </h2>
        <p>
            To avoid falling victim to phishing, it's crucial to practice good
            internet hygiene and stay vigilant. Phishing campaigns, like the one 
            you encountered here, often rely on creating a sense of urgency to
            trick you into acting quickly without thinking. Whether it's an
            offer that seems too good to be true, a deadline that's looming, or
            a warning about your account being compromised, scammers know that
            pressure can cloud judgment. If you're being pushed to act
            immediately &mdash; especially if the request seems unexpected or
            unusual &mdash; this is a major red flag. Always take a moment to
            pause, verify the source, and consider whether the situation truly
            requires urgent action. Trusting your instincts and taking the time
            to double-check can save you from falling into a phishing trap.

        <h2>
            Who are we and why are we doing this?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This campaign was organized by Benjamin Metzger and Lana Sorak, two
            first-year Web & Mobile Computing students. It serves as our final
            research project for the LLL Introduction to Cybersecurity course,
            which took place over spring break. Our assignment was to research
            the production of phishing campaigns, and you are part of our data
            collection. When we present our project tonight, we'll include the
            data on how many people scanned the QR code. Therefore, we kindly
            ask that you refrain from warning others about our campaign or
            removing any of the flyers. We will handle the removal of the flyers
            ourselves after our presentation tonight. Below, you can see the
            number of people who scanned our QR code. This data helps us
            understand the effectiveness of phishing tactics and gives us
            valuable insights into human behavior in the face of online threats.
            We have not collected any personal or device information from you.
            The purpose of this exercise is purely educational, and we respect
            your privacy. By understanding how phishing attempts work, we can
            all become more informed and prepared to protect ourselves in the
            digital world.
